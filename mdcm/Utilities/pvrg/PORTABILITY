For PC's the portability problem may be in the shift-division in the
DCT's and the UNIX calls open, read, ftruncate, etc.

For modification of the lexer.l file: Lex does not accept comments in
the heading, unfortunately, the automatic header program puts that at
the top.  Put the first comment (pvrg disclaimer, etc.) into the %{ %}
body and all should be fine.
